  "description": "A high-level, component-based, interaction system for creating VR and AR experiences. It provides a framework that makes 3D and UI interactions available from Unity input events. The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components, and an Interaction Manager that ties these two types of components together. It also contains components that you can use for locomotion and drawing visuals.",

    "changelog": "### Fixed\r\n- Fixed wrong offset when selecting an `XRGrabInteractable` with Track Rotation disabled when the Attach Transform had a different rotation than the Interactable's rotation. This configuration was not covered in the related fix made previously in version [2.0.0-pre.6](#200-pre6---2021-12-15). ([1361271](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1361271))\r\n- Fixed XR Socket Interactor hover mesh position and rotation for an XR Grab Interactable with Track Position and/or Track Rotation disabled.\r\n- Fixed the simulated controllers not working in projects where the Scripting Backend was set to IL2CPP.\r\n- Fixed the simulated HMD `deviceRotation` not being set. It now matches the `centerEyeRotation`.\r\n- Fixed the **GameObject &gt; XR &gt; AR Annotation Interactable** menu item when AR Foundation is installed to add the correct component.\r\n- Fixed **UIInputModule** so it uses and resets [`PointerEventData.useDragThreshold`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.PointerEventData.html#UnityEngine_EventSystems_PointerEventData_useDragThreshold) to allow users to ignore the drag threshold by implementing [`IInitializePotentialDragHandler`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.IInitializePotentialDragHandler.html). It was previously being ignored and causing sliders and scrollbars to incorrectly use a drag threshold."
